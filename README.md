## 💼 About Me

With over **11 years of professional experience**, I specialize in designing and developing robust web applications, secure APIs, and data integration workflows. I've worked across industries like **higher education, healthcare, retail, government, and research**, contributing to digital transformation through scalable, maintainable systems.

I enjoy bridging technical depth with leadership — mentoring developers, refining SDLC processes, and aligning tech strategy with business goals.

### 💡 Key Highlights:
- 💻 Built full-stack enterprise applications using **C#, ASP.NET MVC 4/5, Web API 2, .NET Core 1.0 - 9+, Angular 2+, jQuery, and HTML5**
- 🧠 Designed complex database logic and reporting with **Oracle PL/SQL**, **SQL Server**, and **ETL tools**
- 🔐 Implemented OAuth2 and OIDC with **Duende IdentityServer** and legacy OWIN-based auth systems
- ⚙️ Led modernization of legacy monoliths into modular .NET Core services with CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code
- 📊 Created data visualizations, reports, and pipelines for clinical trial systems and business intelligence
- 🏥 Passionate about healthcare technology, imaging systems (DICOM/XNAT/OHIF), and data-driven solutions
