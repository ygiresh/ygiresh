- `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch` – basic model experimentation and deployment setups  
- `LangChain`, `LLM APIs`, and prompt engineering for intelligent automation  
- REST API integrations with third-party AI services (Azure AI, Google AI) 

### 🔄 Areas of Focus
- Automating data transformation and reporting workflows  
- Enhancing UI/UX with AI-assisted features (e.g., summarization, segmentation, recommendations) (Monai, SAM, Med-SAM) 
- Building intelligent agents that support development, QA, and decision-making  (Agentic AI)
- Exploring AI's role in system design, documentation, and code refactoring (Codex, Co-Pilot Agent)

**Other Interests:**  
🩺 Clinical Research Tech | 📷 Medical Imaging (DICOM, OHIF, XNAT) | 🛠️ Clean Architecture | 🔄 Data Engineering | 🧪 Integration Testing
